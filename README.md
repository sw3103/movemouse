# Prerequisites
You will need to install the "Windows SDK for UWP Managed Apps" feature from the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/), and update the reference to Windows.winmd library in Visual Studio before you will be able to successfully compile.

This is ONLY required for compiling the source code, and not running Move Mouse itself.
